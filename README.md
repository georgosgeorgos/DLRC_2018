## Experiments

### Hypothesis 1 (GMM on single-point LiDAR)

- Setup simple trajectory (circle)
- Sample signals at equidistant steps (10) for some runs (iid; 2 - static and dynamic environment)
- Visualize all signals within runs in histograms
- Visualize signals timesteps
- Prepare data for GMM like this: One datapoint is one histogram of values at one timestep within a run
